According to the wishes and requests of several of the members of the shedra at the Gyalwang Karmapa&#8217;s main seat at Rumtek Monastery, this lowly disciple known as Bokar Khenpo Lodr&#246; D&#246;ny&#246; composed these verses concerning the immense qualities of the supreme refuge, our excellent Vajradhara, in humility and without artifice. They are just a drop but written with devotion. May whatever virtue there be from putting them together lead to meeting the glorious guru and being supported by him life after life after life.
