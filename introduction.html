		Introduction
	</h1>
	<p class="body_first-chap">
		A truly great spiritual being such as the Goshir Gyaltsabpa is the outcome of a long and magnificent past, a beautiful story of great goodness. To meet him establishes a sacred connection with an impressive future, ending in enlightenment itself. In between that past and future, what we witness as his current activity is merely the crest of a wave in the vast ocean of his uninterrupted benefiting of thousands of beings.
	</p>
	<p class="body_ind">
		To help us appreciate this more fully, some of the worthiest Tibetan masters recently compiled a <span class="body_itals">namtar</span> (“lives of liberation”) concerning the Gyaltsab line. Much more than a series of hagiographies, this text opens up a sublime cosmic vision of these unique beings, giving us insight into how the Karmapas and other realised masters view the Gyaltsab reincarnations, how they interpret their qualities as being the manifestions of the various buddhas and how they feel the power of past great lives resonating through the Gyaltsabpas into the present.
	</p>
	<p class="body_ind">
		In the more worldly, more approachable aspects of these namtar, we see the Gyaltsab Rinpoches as the ongoing story of Ananda—Buddha Sakyamuni’s closest companion and the central reference, immediately after the Buddha’s passing away, for establishing the Enlightened One’s teaching, the dharma, that has sustained the Buddhist world for two and a half millennia. Through Ananda we have trustworthy versions of the discourses given over the forty-five years of the Buddha’s teaching and filling, in the Tibetan canon, over one hundred substantial volumes.
	</p>
	<p class="body_ind">
		Moving forward through time, we find him in Tibet, first in the seventh century, at the time when King Songtsen Gampo made serious efforts to introduce dharma to that land and, in order to do so, had the Tibetan written language created. He was one of that king’s key ministers, Gartongtsen. He reappears in the eighth century, as Karchen Palji Wangchuk, one of Guru Rinpoche’s main disciples at the time of the dharma arriving more stably and so splendidly in that land.
	</p>
	<p class="body_ind">
		Later, during the eleventh century and the second great wave of Buddhism going to Tibet, we find him first as the great founding master of the Khadampa tradition, Dromtönpa, whose disciples gave us the first written version of the <span class="body_itals">Seven Point Mind Training</span>. We find him soon after as one of Milarepa’s greatest yogic disciples and founding masters of the Marpa Kagyu tradition, Rechungpa, as well as the great yogi Shiwa Ö.
	</p>
	<p class="body_ind">
		The next mention comes a few centuries later, with the manifestation of the first of the masters bearing the Gyaltsab name and title. <span class="body_itals">Gyaltsab</span> means <span class="body_itals">regent</span> or royal ambassador, a title given due to his role as main holder of the Karma Kagyu lineage transmissions, received from the Sixth Gyalwang Karmapa, Tongwa Dönden. He became the main guru of the Seventh Gyalwang, Chödrak Gyamtso. From that time until today, his profound link with the Karma Kagyu tradition has continued through twelve successive incarnations, each one exhibiting the qualities of highest realisation and extraordinary accomplishment. The Gyaltsab incarnations have become one of the main pillars of the Karma Kagyu (also called Karma Kamtsang) tradition.
	</p>
	<p class="body_ind">
		On a more cosmic level, Gyaltsab Rinpoche is seen as the presence in our world of bodhisattva Vajrapani. <span class="body_itals">Pani</span> means holder and <span class="body_itals">Vajra</span> refers to the timeless, immutable teachings of Vajrayana. Vajrapani is the bodhisattva who brings the various Vajrayana (tantric) teachings to those worlds in which they are suited, bringing them in the right way and at the appropriate time. Traditionally, there are both wrathful and peaceful forms of Vajrapani.
	</p>
	<p class="body_ind">
		The present incarnation is highly respected for his purity as a monk, for his tremendous erudition as a scholar, for his total mastery of the Vajrayana teachings and in particular for the way in which his various strengths and skills have “held” the Karma Kamtsang tradition during difficult times.
	</p>
	<p class="body_ind">
		This remarkable teacher is as elusive as mercury to define. At times strict yet also capable of amazing tenderness, a mountain of peace yet someone of lightning intelligence, a picture of seriousness with unexpected humour and laughter: in the end, he is the entire mandala of enlightened expression. As the present Gyalwang Karmapa said, on the occasion of Gyaltsab Rinpoche’s 60th birthday . . . as seen on the following pages.
