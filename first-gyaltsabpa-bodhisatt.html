When he had reached the age of five, the sixth Gyalwang Karmapa Tongwa Dönden recognised him as being an emanation of Karchen Palji Wanchuk and Répa Shiwa Ö and thereafter took him personally under the shelter of his great compassion. </span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">The rain of lineage blessing showered on him at the age of fourteen when, in the great encampment that was the ornament of this world he was instated as </span><span class="c4">Gui Gungpa</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote1" id="footnote-ref1"><span class="c5"><sup>1</sup></span></a><span class="c2"> and recognised as being a lord of the teachings in both their key aspects. He received full ordination from the Sixth Gyalwang and, along with the great Bengar Jampal Zangpo, spent four years totally dedicated to the practice of the Six Yogas. With a profound intention of benefiting his future incarnations he inherited the wealth of both Nyingma and Sarma traditions extant in Tibet at that time by receiving scriptural transmissions—first and foremost of the Kanjur</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote2" id="footnote-ref2"><span class="c3"><sup>2</sup></span></a><span class="c2"> and Tenjur</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote3" id="footnote-ref3"><span class="c3"><sup>3</sup></span></a><span class="c2">—from the Third Shamarpa, Chöpel Yeshe, from the great master pandita of Tibet Nyakpupa Sönam Zangpo, from illustrious Bengar and others. It was through this compassionate service that he became a true holder of the entirety of the buddhadharma, in its various quintessential meanings, present in the vast land of Tibet at that time.  </span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">In 1452, the Water Monkey year, the Sixth Gyalwang, who was about to pass away into peace, bestowed upon Goshir Rinpoche his own sacred texts, dharma items, crown, testamentary letter and thirteen edicts, establishing him as his regent</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote4" id="footnote-ref4"><span class="c3"><sup>4</sup></span></a><span class="c2"> and putting him in charge of the great Karmapa encampment and entrusting it into his care.  </span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">The first Gyaltsabpa had constructed a stupa and memorial hall for the remains of Tongwa Dönden. He also restored the two pinnacle facets of the damaged palace roof. As regards the troubled times for the great black treasury of Tsurphu, he was invited to Kongpo-tse temple, declaring that </span><span class="c4">bad surroundings were happiness</span><span class="c2">, of which the Eight Gyalwang Mikyö Dorjé said:</span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2"> “He was the great bodhisattva and finest spiritual friend serving the Gyalwang Tongwa Dönden, who having offered true dedicated service to the Karmapa also brought a tremendous wave of benefit to the people of that epoch. </span><span class="c9">Further, when (the Buddha) had displayed passing into nirvana, in order that his teachings bring a major wave of benefit to sentient being, the immeasurable spiritual heritage he left was entrusted to this bodhisattva who inherited his dharma throne and legacy, being the Victor Maitreya and, as Arya Ananda, the holder of his secret dharma treasury        </span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">As foretold in the testamentary letter of the Sixth Gyalwang, the Seventh was born in the northen land of Chila to the parents predicted. Goshir Rinpoche recognised the ninth-month-old Karmapa (1454-1506), meeting him for the first time in his new incarnation in the Wood Dog year at the Nyewo monastery where the brilliant presence of the supreme tulku filled him with great joy and blessing. Having presented him with gifts he proceeded to introduce the child to </span><span class="c9">his former object</span><span class="c2">s and presented him with his former crown. When being handed his former vajra and bell, the child took them and spontaneous performed the ritual ‘lotus roll’ and ‘bell gesture’ mudras with them, to the great amazement and wonder of the venerable Goshir who subsequently installed the child on the high lion throne of the ornament of the world and leader of the mighty Karmapa encampment</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote5" id="footnote-ref5"><span class="c3"><sup>5</sup></span></a><span class="c2">, calling him </span><span class="c4">Rangjung Kunchen Chö Ji Jalpo</span><span class="c2">, the Dharma King, Omniscient and Spontaneously-Arising. At a time of auspicious Jupiter conjunction on the (first) waxing (of the) moon of the third lunar month of the Earth Tiger year,when the Seventh Gyalwang reached the age of five, the Goshir Gyaltsabpa restored the auspicious link between them by conferring some scriptural transmissions, ‘</span><span class="c4">lung</span><span class="c2">’, of the teachings bestowed on him by the previous Gyalwang, starting by giving the outer, inner and secret empowerments, along with torma blessings, of Amitayus, also the Six Syllables</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote6" id="footnote-ref6"><span class="c3"><sup>6</sup></span></a><span class="c2">, the ancestors of all language, i.e. the vowels and consonants of Sanskrit and Tibetan, along with many instructions on complex topics concerning the conferring of empowerments—such as how to properly handle and use ceremonial vases, vajra and bell and so forth. </span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">On the full-moon day of the third month in the Year of the Hare (1462), when transmitting the sacred Kalachakra empowerment and so forth, and making the gesture of firing the arrow, using the ceremonial bow and arrow use to designate wisdom and skilful means, he declared that Saraha and the eighty siddhas had shown how the arrow needed to be fired in such-and-such a way and that he was they. When transmitting the empowerment of the thirteen-fold mandala of Chakrasamvara, from the first day of the fourth month onwards, the illustrious Goshir was using a very heavy flower-garland mala made of precious stones and precious materials which, when he extended his hand to offer it, stretched exceptionally far—all the way in fact to the empowerment mandala construction and the Seventh Gyalwangs own throne—with the main deity slowly appearing atop the gems as a wonderful and amazing insight into it being the sacred container of the mandala of the deities. </span><span class="c10">When receiving the Mahamaya empowerment, the Karmapa adopted the deity’s posture and said that this had not been shown. Further, during an empowerment ritual he requested certain posture aspects to be shown, saying that previously, when at Kangmar, Zurmang and Karmi Gön, that was what was done and at that time he was fully-grown but now he was only small and needed that instruction</span><span class="c2">.  </span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">In the great </span><span class="c11">rngod gshongs ‘khor</span><span class="c2">, looking at Goshir Rinpoche, he said: “Suffering is purified in the dharmakaya; the uninterrupted and varied play is dealt with skilfully in the inseparability of primordial wisdom and voidness. That is my ‘life and liberation</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote7" id="footnote-ref7"><span class="c3"><sup>7</sup></span></a><span class="c2">’.”</span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">According to the Seventh Gyalwang’s wish, the fourth Shamar incarnation was invited to join them. They got on well together as they received many dharma teachings from the Gyaltsabpa. The latter gave the full Upasaka precepts to the fourth Shamarpa at Kangmar. Further, in the first month of the Sheep year, the first Gyaltsab bestowed on the young Shamar transmissions of the five-deity Vajravarahi, the four-deity Daka Hayagriva, the nine-deity Gyalwa Gyamtso, the </span><span class="c4">Total Liberation of the Three Realms</span><span class="c2"> form of Hayagriva, the nine-deity Hévajra from patriarch Ngokpa, the fifteen-deity form of Anatma</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote8" id="footnote-ref8"><span class="c3"><sup>8</sup></span></a><span class="c2">, the cycle of teachings of the </span><span class="c4">Hearing Lineage</span><span class="c2"> form of Chakrasamvara, the torma empowerment of the Cloaked One, Sridevi and the dharma protectors, the </span><span class="c4">Wish-Fulfilling Mind Instruction, </span><span class="c2">the </span><span class="c4"> Mahamudra Making Clear Primordial Wisdom, Sahaja Mahamudra, </span><span class="c2">the </span><span class="c4">Collected Doha of Milarepa</span><span class="c2"> and also the scriptural transmissions of the collected works of Shamar Kachö Wangpo and Karmapa Tongwa Dönden.</span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">Soon after, when the Shamarpa was ten and while staying at Surmang, the Goshir Gyaltsab supervised his training as a novice monk, along with Bengar Zangpo. </span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">On the fourteenth day of the Monkey year, on the auspicious astrological occasion known as </span><span class="c4">accomplishing bodhicitta</span><span class="c2"> and when Venus was nominally conjunct with the </span><span class="c4">Revata</span><span class="c2"> constellation</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote9" id="footnote-ref9"><span class="c3"><sup>9</sup></span></a><span class="c2">, a rain of flowers fell as the Gyaltsabpa gave full Sramanera vows and bodhisattva vows, along with the approrpiate advice, to the Gyalwang Karmapa at his traditional seat of Karmi Gön, before the Gandhola representation/in the Gandhola shrine. Rainbows filled the sky in each of the directions.</span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">In the Saga Dawa sacred fourth lunar month of the Wood Bird year, just after dawn on the full moon day that is a threefold commemoration of Shakyamuni, the Karmapa received the full novice ordination before the magnificent representations of Gandhola, that of the Buddha taming the island of Singhala, </span><span class="c4">Chulönma</span><span class="c2">, and so forth, in a perfect ceremony presided over by he who was the crowning glory of all the great dharmas of India and Tibet and whose ocean of qualities is impossible to fathom, i.e. the bodhisattva Goshir Paljor Döndrup, with precepting abbot Kunchen Jampal Zangpo. He received the name Chödrak Gyamtso Pal Zangpo and dedicated himself to perfecting his trainings in the Sramanera monastic vows under the guidance of Mahasiddha Tashi Paljor, the first Sangye Nyenpa incarnation, the great Bengar and Goshir Rinpoche.</span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">From Goshir Rinpoche he then received empowerment and scriptural transmissions for </span><span class="c4">Ocean of Dakinis, </span><span class="c2">the three transmissions of Samvara—</span><span class="c4">Lu, Nak </span><span class="c2">and</span><span class="c4"> Dril,</span><span class="c2"> the three transmissions of mastery of Hévajra, </span><span class="c4">Hayagriva Tukdril, </span><span class="c2">the peaceful and wrathful aspects of Guru Rinpoche, the three—</span><span class="c4">Nak, Jal</span><span class="c2"> and </span><span class="c4">Pak</span><span class="c2">, the outer, inner and secret aspects of Amitayus according to Jé Dönden, Mahamaya, the Abhisambhodi of Vairochana and </span><span class="c4">Kunrik.</span><span class="c2"> He also received the empowerment and scriptural transmission of Akshobya and other practices, the ritual transmissions of </span><span class="c4">Tanak, </span><span class="c2">the Ten Wrathful, blue Akshobya, Lhamo, the five-fold entourage and so forth. He also received teachings on the Six Yogas according to his teacher Goshir Rinpoche’s own composition, as well as those on Sahaja Mahamudra according to the great former Karmapas Rangjung (Dorjé), Rolpi Dorjé and (Tongwa) Dönden, the Seven Sections on Mahamudra and every treatise on the Six Yogas such as the Vajra Stanzas and so forth. He also received from the Gyaltsabpa transmission of the entire writings from the former Karmapas going back therefore to the time of Jé Gampopa, as well as the collected writings of the two great masters, Shamar Kachö and Tsurphu Jamyang, along with all the special instructions associated with them, as well as instructions concerning the dharmapalas. Thus through having properly received these properly bestowed teachings, in great accomplisment the Goshir Rinpoche served the Gyalwang Karmapa as his supreme guru. As he was praised: </span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">“I pay homage at the feet of </span><span class="c11">Jé Gui Gung Pa</span><span class="c4">, </span><span class="c2">the</span><span class="c4"> </span><span class="c2">Lord and Protector of living beings, Chenrezik, He who nurtures the activity of the Kagyu, the one bearing the name Bodhisattva Paljor Döndrup.”  </span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">Jetsun Tashi Özer says that the one honoured as a supreme guru by Gyalwang Mikyö Dorjé was the Goshir Rinpoche who gave the ordination. According to the Seventh Gyalwang’s writings, it was the illustrious Goshir Rinpoche and also (later) the third Tai Situpa, Tashi Paljor, who were responsible for making the major image of Nirmanakaya Buddha Sakyamuni in the Karmapa seat of Karmi Gön.</span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">In 1476, the Fire Monkey year, while travelling from the great encampment to Lhasa, the Ming emperor Chingtung conferred an official title document on </span><span class="c4">Gui Gungpa</span><span class="c2"> Bodhisattva Paljor Döndrup as “Kenting Tai Goshir”, bearing six embellishments and the golden seal. He also presented him with a deep blue crown. However bodhisattvas have the very basic and true nature, i.e. dharmata, that never knew any wish for greatness or for fame, no arrogance, desire and attachment or competitive attitude, and he was therefore beyond any thought of being made equal to the Karmapas through possessing such a similar crown, knowing the deep blue crown to be a symbol of the inner presence of Buddha Vajradhara.   </span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">When the seventh Gyalwang was still young and being offered teachings by his two gurus, they each stayed in small retreat cabins, the whole time being devoted to teaching, study and retreat. In order to cater to the needs of important people seeking them out, Goshir Rinpoche would give the empowerments, lineage explanations and practice instructions and Bengar Rinpoche the teachings on </span><span class="c4">Chö</span><span class="c2">, Mahamudra, the Six Yogas and so forth. In general, wherever the seventh Gyalwang stayed there were rainbows and showers of flowers and wherever he visited, infectious diseases subsided and places prospered. Many tens of thousands of people would gather in normally deserted valleys: in the daytime humans would circumnambulate his settlement and by night devas and spirits. That was the way it was. In the encampment, meat and alcohol were banned and such discipline made it known as the “ornament of this world”, a name merited not only by how it seemd outwardly but also by how it was in an inner sense. <br/>The great Karma Tinlaypa was a heart-son of the seventh Gyalwang and became the guru of the eighth, Karmapa Mikyö Dorje. In the concise version of his hagiography, presented through question and answer, it says, </span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">“Concerning </span><span class="c4">Guyi Gungpa</span><span class="c2">: he had received his teachings from the previous Gyalwang Tongwa Dönden and conferred the empowerments and scriptural transmissions to the following incarnation. Through his ikindness in having assimilated absolutely all the dharma that was to be had in Tibet, he was foremost in holding the transmission of the Kanjur</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote10" id="footnote-ref10"><span class="c3"><sup>10</sup></span></a><span class="c2"> and the Tenjur</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote11" id="footnote-ref11"><span class="c3"><sup>11</sup></span></a><span class="c2">  and, as there was no dharma he had not received, he was the living encyclopaedia holding them all. For some thirty-one years he was the companion of the Gyalwang, like his own shadow. When conferring the entire Kalachakra, it was done with such great understanding that both master and student thought that not only in Tibet but in all the world there could be nothing rarer than that. The Gyalwang Karmapa </span><span class="c9">took a hundred empowerments from his precious guru and these inspired his monastic path of renunciation.</span><span class="c2"> Although the Gyalwa Karmapa received many empowerments, scriptural transmissions, practice advice according to the tradition, the actual basis making possible the myriad things he learned was </span><span class="c4">Gui Gungpa</span><span class="c2">.”</span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">In 1485, in the Wood Monkey year, Goshir Rinpoche conferred all the scriptural transmissions as a gift to the fourth Shamarpa emanation Chöji Trakpa. In the testamentary letter he entrusted to the great Seventh Karmapa, Goshir Rinpoche indicated that the Shamar tulku should fill the gap made by his passing, asking him to complete the unfinished work of the two predecessors in Kongpo</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote12" id="footnote-ref12"><span class="c3"><sup>12</sup></span></a><span class="c2"> and praying that the master and disciple should ever be inseparable in the future.</span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">The first Gyaltsabpa continued turning the wheel of dharma until his sixty-third year and passed away into peace in 1486, when the Seventh Karmapa was thirty-three years of age. In the Eighth Karmapa Mikyö Dorje’s more concise hagiography of the latter, he says in one of the other commentaries to the composition elucidating the sole intention of the Drikung:</span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">“The great Tongwa Döndon had a disciple, the illustrious Goshir Paljor Döndrup who was well-known as being an emanation of Jetsun Shiwa Ö, the very embodiment of the teachings on definitive meaning. In terms of the person himself, he served Karmapa Tongwa Dönden with great faith and devotion from the age of eight onwards, putting the teachings and methods he learned well into practice. He attended on his guru so excellently it was exactly like (apart from the broken thigh bone) the perfect example of discipleship shown by the life-story of Saraprarudita</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote13" id="footnote-ref13"><span class="c3"><sup>13</sup></span></a><span class="c2">. He became the vessel holding absolutely all the secret teachings. Through the path of mantrayana, like a magical conjuration he displayed the attainment of the fusional state of mighty Vajradhara in one life and one body and it was that Jetsun that mighty Chödrak Gyamtso encountered.”</span></p><p class="s4"><span class="c2">At the time of uncovering his relics following the cremation, there were amazing manifestations such as rainbows and showers of flowers of various colours, among which were pale blue ones </span><span class="c9">on stems</span><span class="c2">. The relics were later enshrined for the encampment. The heart self-manifested </span><span class="c9">...</span><span class="c2"> and relics from the torso </span><span class="c9">were requested by Zhungluk Ling</span><span class="c2">. When the great Karma Tinlaypa was being invested as supreme abbot of Chökhor Lungpo, he had built a single-storey stupa to contain </span><span class="c4">ringsel</span><a href="footnotes.xhtml#footnote14" id="footnote-ref14"><span class="c5"><sup>14</sup></span></a><span class="c2"> relics of Goshir Rinpoche. The first Goshir left for posterity eighteen volumes of his own writings. These were held in Pawo Rinpoche’s Nénang monastery, according to the personal account of the general secretary Karma Tsultrim. The Tsurphu encampment itself was well-known as holding the </span><span class="c4">Hundred-fold Teachings of Goshir’s Collected Works</span><span class="c2">.      </span></p></div></body></html>
