# Dreaming The Dharma Journeys

This website is to accompany a recently compiled a **namtar** (“lives of liberation”) book  by Tibetan masters  concerning the Gyaltsab line. Much more than a series of hagiographies, it gives insight into how the Karmapas and other realised masters view the Gyaltsab reincarnations, how they interpret their qualities as being the manifestions of the various buddhas and how they feel the power of past great lives resonating through the Gyaltsabpas into the present.

This book is a work in progress and updates will happen periodically.
